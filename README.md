Analysis of Factors In uencing Poverty in the United States

Poverty's consequences can be severe and lead to families that are persistently poor across genera-
tions.Poverty imposes huge costs on society through lost productivity and higher spending on health
care and incarceration.Hence, understanding poverty levels is important for generating policy, target-
ing development initiatives, and monitoring and evaluating economic progress over time. This research
seeks to answer the following two questions: 1. whether there are di erences between states in terms of
poverty, and 2. what social and economic factors correlate to high or low poverty rates. This empirical
study was conducted using data on more than 3000 counties from 50 states in the United States. To
tease out the statistical di erences between states in terms of poverty, I employ graphical approaches
(barplot and choropleth map) and a statistical test (chi-square test), and I  nd that % under poverty
level varies across states. Fitting various binomial and quaisbinomial models, the dependent variable,
poverty (proportion of a county's population below poverty level), was correlated with social and eco-
nomic variables, namely gender, education, unemployment, race, some sectors of employment, Ways of
transportation and types of work. This study  nds signi cant evidence in support of previous literature.
