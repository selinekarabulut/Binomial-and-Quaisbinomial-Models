Analysis of Factors Influencing Poverty in the United States

The consequences of poverty can have far-reaching and enduring effects, often perpetuating through multiple generations. Poverty places significant burdens on society, leading to diminished productivity and increased expenditures on healthcare and incarceration. Consequently, gaining insights into poverty levels holds great importance for shaping policies, directing developmental efforts, and monitoring and evaluating long-term economic progress.

This research aims to address two fundamental questions:

Are there disparities in poverty levels among different states?
What social and economic factors are associated with high or low poverty rates?
To answer these questions, an empirical study was conducted using data from over 3,000 counties across all 50 states in the United States. Various analytical approaches were employed, including graphical methods such as barplots and choropleth maps, as well as statistical tests like the chi-square test. These analyses revealed notable variations in the percentage of individuals living below the poverty line across different states.

Furthermore, this study utilized a range of binomial and quasi-binomial models to explore the relationship between the dependent variable, poverty (measured as the proportion of a county's population living below the poverty threshold), and various social and economic variables. These variables included factors such as gender, education, unemployment rates, racial composition, specific employment sectors, modes of transportation, and types of work.

The findings of this study provide substantial empirical evidence that aligns with existing literature on the subject.
